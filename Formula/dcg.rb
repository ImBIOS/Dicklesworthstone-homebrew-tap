      DCG (Destructive Command Guard) blocks dangerous commands from AI coding agents.

      Quick start:
        dcg test "rm -rf /"        # Test if a command would be blocked
        dcg explain "git push -f"  # See why a command is flagged
        dcg doctor                 # Verify installation

      To integrate with Claude Code, add to hooks:
        See: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard#integration

  end

  test do
    system bin/"dcg", "--version"
  end
end
